# Proposed Wasatch Forge Website Changes

To utilize this file fully you need to have a browser extension installed that will allow you to utilize what are called "User Styles"
I personally recommend (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne)[Stylus] for Google Chrome.



##Usage and Installation:
- Install either Stylus or another User Style manager for your browser.
