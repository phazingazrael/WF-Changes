# Proposed Wasatch Forge Website Changes

To utilize this file fully you need to have a browser extension installed that will allow you to utilize what are called "User Styles"

I personally recommend [Stylus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne) for Google Chrome.



## Usage and Installation:
> **Note**
> 
> Instructions below assume you have installed Stylus, Steps may be similar for other extensions but cannot be guaranteed

- Install either Stylus or another User Style manager for your browser.
- Find the installed extension icon, if you installed Stylus it will look like a greyed out {S} icon.
- Right click the icon and select Manage Styles.
- In the window that opens up you will see a menu on the left side, Find the button that says "Write New Style" and click it.
- Open the customCss file in this repository, or click [Here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phazingazrael/WF-Changes/main/customCss.css).
- Once the customCss file has opened, select all of the contained text and paste over all existing information in that "Write New Style" window.
- Click Save, then visit the [Wasatch Forge Website](http://www.wasatchforge.com).
