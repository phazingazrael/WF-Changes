# Proposed Wasatch Forge Website Changes

To utilize this file fully you need to have a browser extension installed that will allow you to utilize what are called "User Styles"

I personally recommend [Stylus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne) for Google Chrome.



## Usage and Installation:
- Install either Stylus or another User Style manager for your browser.
